# widget 

The Project was developed during NWL Return, a week-long event. The event had two learning trails.
The Origin track was aimed at beginners in programming in which the basic technologies of the web, HTML, CSS and Javascript
were demonstrated. The Impulse track was aimed at more experienced programmers, a complete application was developed with
ReactJs, NodeJs, React Native PostgreSQL. The project present in this repository was the result of the impulse track, which was to develop a
feedback widget where the user can leave a comment along with a screenshot of the screen to report a Bug, a suggestion or other opinion.

## Overview

### Front end

Fronte end was developed with three stages, the first stage the user clicks on the icon in the
corner of the screen, the second stage the user selects the type of feedback, leaves a comment about
the feedback and finally chooses whether or not to take a screenshot and then click on send feedback, in 
the third stage a success screen is displayed in case of successful submission and the data is saved in the database.
